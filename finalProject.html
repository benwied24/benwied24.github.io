Poem of 4/5/24 - Daydreaming<br>
</h1>
<p>
<span id="song">(SONG)</span>
In the midst of some test, some class, and some place, <br>
I grasp and drift away on daydream's geszticulating wing,<br>
Weaving me through the <span id="cloudsbluesky">(clouds and blue sky)</span> alike,<br>
To the realm of fantasy of which boredom brings about,<br>
<br>
Drifting into a world of wonder,<br>
Where reality and worldly concerns fade away,<br>
Where fierce <span id="dragonsroar">(dragons roar)</span>, giants slumber, and taverns <span id="tavernsbuzz">(buzz and hum)</span>
<br>
In whispered echoes of fantastical shades.<br>
<br>
But, as soon as it began, a <span id="bell">(bell rings)</span>, bringing about a utopia’s conclusion,<br>
Back to what’s real, where daydreams must suspend.<br>
From a world where fantasy lingers free, to a beckoning and harsh reality,<br>
In which I, head down, dejectedly hand in an incomplete test.<br>
<br><br>

<h1>
Poem of 4/8/24 - Winter's Warm Embrace<br>
</h1>
<p>
Clutched in winter’s icy grip, I lie still,<br> 
Held dearly in a frosty chill to innovate,<br>
Harsh, <span id="wind">(biting winds)</span> whisper tales of snow,<br>
As I integrate into the frostbitten landscape.<br><br>

Beneath the gray sky I lie among the white,<br>
Peacefully freezezing in a blanket of sharp crystals,<br>
Penetrating my body at every joint and flap of flesh prompts<br>
An icy cold to seep into each and every bone,<br><br>

My head spins, and yet the <span id="world">(world remains frozen still)</span><br>
I rise up, up from my slumbering comfort at death’s doorstep,<br>
I weave methodically with the north wind through the snow-capped trees,<br>
Journeying back home, to the <span id="cabin">(Cabin)</span> once known,<br><br>

As my thought of winter's freeze becomes a distant one,<br>
As the hearth comforts me in its conforming embrace,<br>
As I nestle and settle in the arms of the night,<br>
I am comforted with a steaming cup of cocoa, a wool blanket, and a flickering <span id="tv">(TV)</span>.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/11/24 - Whispers of Fall<br>
</h1>
<p>
sheltered under summer’s warm embrace,<br>
(sprawled across the hammock) like a starfish, eyes closed,<br>
intaking summer’s graceful, sun-kissed, mellow squeeze,<br>
a season dancing wild and free.<br><br>

and yet, as slowly as it began, nature’s canvas is painted over with hues of fall,<br>
from summer's <span id="green">(spirited greens)</span> to <span id="red">(fiery reds)</span>,<br>
a canvas entralled in a colorful sprawl,<br>
a symphony of an ever changing colors to behold.<br><br>

and yet, throughout it all, a tinge of bittersweet,<br>
as those dear summer days slip from my grasp, onto their swift retreat,<br>
for in the distance looms a bell's haunting <span id="ring">(ring)</span>,<br>
as a summoning to those abhorred dark and cold school halls again.
<br><br><br>

<h1>
Poem of 4/14/24 - A Dancing Spring<br>
</h1>
<p>
From (rushing streams) and babbling creeks,<br>
To (chriping birds) and the whistling wind,<br>
The melody of renewed life rejuvenates nature's tune,<br>
One once put to rest at fall's heartfelt end.<br><br>

Dancing gleefully free in my backyard,<br>
Spinning and twirling in the midst of nature's might,<br>
As whispers of warmth weave through the air,<br>
Each bud unfurls, painting landscapes with hues so fair.<br><br>

With each soft breeze, a new symphony unfolds,<br>
As life renews in every sway,<br>
In whose embrace, the heart beholds,<br>
The promise of a season brand-new.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/17/24 - Summertime<br>
</h1>
<p>
As (children's laughter) rings in parks,<br>
Fireflies dance in fiery sparks,<br>  
Beachside picnics buzz and hum,  <br>
Magic spun in summer's embracing shawl.<br><br>

(Ocean) whisper and wash against the shore,<br>
Soaring skies, vibrant sands,<br>
Boats gently sway and glide,<br>
As sails unfurlling with the tide.<br><br>

As summers' arms extend,<br>
Flashing, golden light that will not end,<br> 
Fields awash in vibrant bloom,<br>
Air scented with the summer's sweet perfume.<br> 
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/20/24 - Pulled<br>
</h1>
<p>
Reality's edges blur and twine,<br> 
As I am violently ripped from the day,<br>
Silent whispers wrestle me through,<br>
Into the (void) where (light) comes few.<br><br>

Head spinning and swirling, I spiral down, lost and alone,<br>
Beckoning shadows speak, dark and chilly claws outstretched,<br>
Each echo a siren's haunting cry,<br>
Each cry thrusts me deeper, where hopes become few.<br><br>

Yet in this abyss, I feel strangely free,<br>  
Unbound from worldly ties and knots,<br> 
As I find shelter in the abyss' dark cold.<br>
<br><br> 
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/23/24 - Secret life of Objects<br>
</h1>
<p>
Resting on a wood table, I face the bright light<br>
Lying amidst a classroom's stillness<br>
My newly sharpened, graphite tip, <br>
Eager to assist delvation of tales and work to tell.<br><br>

I dance upon the paper without a care.<br>
From math equations to poetry's verse,<br>
I etch secrets and stories,<br>
(Scribbling) away at dreams untold,<br><br>

When the day's last bell rings loud and clear,<br>
I rest in the solitude of my conductor without a fear,<br>
Guarding the stories within my lead,<br>
Until I expire and am thrown into the bin.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/26/24 - House<br>
</h1>
<p>
The sanctuary where connections bloom,<br>
The nexus and catalyst of  youthful dreams,<br>
In House's embrace, we find room,<br>
Through each and every smile and (laugh).<br><br>

Every interaction, a bridge is built,<br>
Every shared laugh, spirits are uplifted,<br>
As in house's haven, we all feel like we belong,<br>
Together, weaving a tapestry forever.<br><br>

So I will cherish this sacred ground,<br>
Where bonds of kinship are tightly wound.<br>
In homeroom's embrace, we stand tall,<br>
Together, united, once and for all.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/28/24 - Solitude<br>
</h1>
<p>
Solitude in the pixels and bytes, I find,<br>
An amazing world grapples at my soul,<br>
Amidst the struggle of the school day's grind,<br>
I seek refuge in realms of a different kind.<br><br>

Worldly worries fade with each button's (click) and joystick's 
(flick)<br>
As I navigate realms and stories,<br>
Away from textbooks and lectures' drone,<br>
I find refuge in a pixelated world.<br><br>

The burdens of homework, the stress of tests,<br>
All melt away as I embark on endless quests.<br>
Through dungeons deep, battles fierce, and mountains high,<br>
I find that peace that nothing else can hope to supply.<br>
<br><br>
