<h1>
Poem of 4/5/24 - Daydreaming
</h1>
<p>
In the midst of some test, some class, and some place,
I grasp and drift away on daydream's gesticulating wing,
Weaving me through the clouds and blue sky alike,
To the realm of fantasy of which boredom brings about,

Drifting into a world of wonder,
Where reality and worldly concerns fade away,
Where fierce dragons roar, giants slumber, and taverns buzz and hum,
In whispered echoes of fantastical shades.

But, as soon as it began, a bell rings, bringing about a utopia’s conclusion,
Back to what’s real, where daydreams must suspend.
From a world where fantasy lingers free, to a beckoning and harsh reality,
In which I, head down, dejectedly hand in an incomplete test.
</p>

Poem of 4/8/24 - Winter's Warm Embrace
</h1>
<p>
Clutched in winter’s icy grip, I lie still, 
Held dearly in a frosty chill to innovate,
Harsh, biting winds whisper tales of snow,
As I integrate into the frostbitten landscape.

Beneath the gray sky I lie among the white,
Peacefully freezezing in a blanket of sharp crystals,
Penetrating my body at every joint and flap of flesh prompts,
An icy cold to seep into each and every bone,

My head spins, and yet the world remains frozen still,
I rise up, up from my slumbering comfort at death’s doorstep,
I weave methodically with the north wind through the snow-capped trees,
Journeying back home, to the Cabin once known,

As my thought of winter's freeze becomes a distant one,
As the hearth comforts me in its conforming embrace,
As I nestle and settle in the arms of the night,
I am comforted with a steaming cup of cocoa, a wool blanket, and a flickering TV.
</p>

Poem of 4/11/24 - Whispers of Fall
</h1>
<p>
sheltered under summer’s warm embrace,
sprawled across the hammock like a starfish, eyes closed,
intaking summer’s graceful, sun-kissed, mellow squeeze,
a season dancing wild and free.

and yet, as slowly as it began, summer’s canvas is painted over with hues of fall,
from spirited greens to fiery reds and golds,
a canvas newly bedecked and enthralled in a colorful sprawl,
a symphony of an ever changing colors to behold.

and yet, throughout it all, a tinge bittersweet,
as those dear summer days slip from my grasp onto their swift retreat,
for in the distance looms a bell’s haunting refrain,
as a summoning to those abhorred dark and cold school halls again,
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/14/24 - A Dancing Spring
</h1>
<p>
From rushing streams and babbling creeks,
To chriping birds and the whistling wind,
The tune of renewed life rejuvenates nature's song,
One once put to rest at fall's heartfelt end.

Dancing free with the backyard's glee,
I spin and twirl in the midst of nature's might,
As whispers of warmth weave through the air,
Each bud unfurls, painting landscapes with hues so fair.


With each soft breeze, a symphony unfolds,
As life renews in every sway,
In whose embrace, the heart beholds,
The promise of a brand-new season.
</p>

Poem of 4/17/24 - Summertime
</h1>
<p>
 

As children's laughter rings in parks,  
Fireflies dance in fiery sparks,  
Beachside picnics buzz and hum,  
Magic spun in summer's embracing shawl.  

Ocean whisper and wash against the shore,  
Soaring skies, vibrant sands,  
Boats gently sway and glide,  
As sails unfurlling with the tide.  

As summers' arms extend,  
Flashing, golden light that will not end,  
Fields awash in vibrant bloom,  
Air scented with the summer's sweet perfume. 
 
</p>

Poem of 4/20/24 - Pulled
</h1>
<p>
Reality's edges blur and twine,  
As I am violently ripped from the day,  
Silent whispers wrestle me through, 
Into the void where light comes few.

Head spinning and swirling, I spiral down, lost and alone,  
Beckoning shadows speak, dark and chilly claws outstretched,
Each echo a siren's haunting cry,  
Each cry thrusts me deeper, where hopes become few.

Yet in this abyss, I feel strangely free,  
Unbound from worldly ties and knots,  
As I find shelter in the abyss' dark cold.
</p>

Poem of 4/23/24 - Secret life of Objects
</h1>
<p>
Resting on a wood table, I face the bright light
Lying amidst a classroom's stillness
My newly sharpened, graphite tip, 
Eager to assist delvation of tales and work to tell.

I dance upon the paper without a care.
From math equations to poetry's verse,
I etch secrets, a symphony to behold.
In the margins of which I scribble dreams untold,

When the day's last bell rings loud and clear,
I rest in the solitude of my conductor without a fear,
Guarding the stories within my lead,
Until I expire and am thrown into the bin.
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/26/24 - House
</h1>
<p>

The sancuary where connections bloom,
The nexus and catalyst of  youthful dreams,
In House's embrace, we find room,
Through each and every smile and laugh.

Through each interaction, a bridge is built,
Through shared laughter, our spirits uplift.
In house's haven, we all feel like we belong,
Together weaving a collective tapestry.

So I will cherish this sacred ground,
Where bonds of kinship are tightly wound.
In homeroom's embrace, we stand tall,
Together, united, once and for all.
</p>

<h1>
Poem of 4/28/24 - Solitude
</h1>
<p>
I find solitude in pixels and bytes,
A grappling and amazing virtual world 
Amidst the struggle of a school day's grind,
I seek refuge in realms of a different kind.

With each button and joystick, my worldy worries fade,
As I navigate realms and stories,
Away from textbooks and lectures' drone,
I find refuge in a pixelated world.

The burdens of homework, the stress of tests,
All melt away as I embark on endless quests.
Through dungeons deep, battles fierce, and mountains high,
I find that peace that nothing else can hope to supply.
