	How to add things to my online version of my website</h2>
</h1>
<p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Open the terminal and navigate to my foler by typing <b>cd ./desktop/benwied24.github.io</b></li>

 	<li> if I want to see if I added anything, I can type <b>git status</b> and it will show me the changes i haven't saved to my online version</li>

 	<li> To add what i made I type <b>git add .</b></li>

 	<li> Then I make my changes and this means adding a little note marking what I did so i say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

 	<li> To finish vinixh ig off and put my changes online I type <b>git push </b></li>

 </ol>

 Yesterday we learned about the terminal, how old computers used to work/operate, and set up our websites on github.com. It was very fun, and I got to be the person to present my screen to avoid confusion and errors i might come across.

 Today we just developed our websites. My position tag doesn't work but I managed to simplify my code so i got something done. I installed a gif for my about me page link and I also got more proficient with the terminal and how to upload progress to the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Today we continued to work on our websites. I struggled with the position command, and hopefully I'll get it done when Ms. Josephs comes back. I added a font into the titeles for the links to my projects/about me/journal. Science test is next and I hope I do well *fingers crossed*
</p>

 Today we developed our websites further, learning how to make boxes, move them around, create borders, and create text within them. I further polished up my website, specifically my journal page, changing fonts and adding new entries.
</p>

<p>
 Today I chose prompt two to develop my websites. I am still not sure about positioning, but I made a lab to go over it. I also added new journal entries and chilled for most of the class, especially since I was stressed about a Math test upcoming later today.
</p>

Today I fixed some of my positioning and made a project which has Pippin (my dog) move up in down on a tree in a forest. I liked making this project, as it familiarized me with importing external images and taught me how to be able to move an image around.
</p>

<p>
  Today we worked on our jumpscares. I made a blank page, that when you click on it, it spawns a creepy clown face which makes a scream and spins around, before disappearing again. It was fun, and I became more familiar with javascript/eventListerners.
</p>

<p>
 Today I developed my project page and added a journal entry I forgot about. I learned how to make a background and how to position better. These are my three question answers: 1) What does clientx/y mean? 2) Why do you need variables in the script? 3) What do the bubbles mean?
</p>

<p>
 Today we worked on our jumpscares and presented them to my class; i added a different sound to mine to make it more jumpscare-y and more funny. It was a good class, but I am stressing about a math quiz today :\
</p>

 Today we worked on making functions in JavaScript which creates an image, duplicates it at random coordinates on the page, and deletes and plays a sound once clicked on. I found this very interesting, as I found other ways to do the same things in Java Script as opposed to CSS, like making divs and styling them (adding width, height, image, etc.).
</p>

<p>
 Today we learned what a function in JavaScript is. It's basically a recipe, the equivilent a coffee maker as opposed to individual functions and divs, the equivilent of brewing coffee individually. It was very interesting to explore functions, as it deepened my understanding of JavaScript and was simply fun.

<p>
 Today we learned more about eventListeners and "if" statements. We continued to work on our websites, beginning a "gratitude" project" using eventListeners and if statements. It was a very fun class and I enjoyed beginning this step of the project
 <h1>
	11/17/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we basically just continued to work on our projects. I learned how to assign a variable (x) and make an eventListener that would record x+1 after every click, saving x as x+1, so that it plays images 1-6.
</p>
<h1>
	11/N/A/23
</h1>
<p>
 I finished my gratitude card. It was basically that when you clik on one coordinate on the screen, a random image, numbered 1-5, will play, containing images of my friends. It was a very fun project where I could do what I want how I wanted to.

 Today we learned about the stigma around ChatGPT andhow to use it. Most people use it as a writing tool, but it's best as a tutor. We asked it questions and analogies to asnwer questions about CSS/Javascript. It was very helpful in 1. understanding aspects of code between the two languages, and 2. clarifing and defining the importance and usefullness of ChatGPT as a tutor and someone to answer questions rather than a writer.
