	How to add things to my online version of my website</h2>
</h1>
<p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Open the terminal and navigate to my folder by typing <b>cd ./desktop/benwied24.github.io</b></li>

 	<li> if I want to see if I added anything, I can type <b>git status</b> and it will show me the changes i haven't saved to my online version</li>

 	<li> To uxpdate what i added I type <b>git add .</b></li>

 	<li> Then I make my changes and this means adding a little note marking what I did so i say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

 	<li> To finish it off and put my changes online I type <b>git push </b></li>

 </ol>

 Today we learned about the terminal, how old computers used to work/operate, and set up our websites on github.com. It was very fun, and I got to be the person to present my screen to avoid confusion and errors i might come across.
</p>

<p>
 Today we just developed our websites. My position tag doesn't work but I managed to simplify my code so i got something done. I installed a gif for my about me page link and I also got more proficient with the terminal and how to upload progress to the internet.
</p>
<h1>
	10/6/23
</h1>
<p>
	Today we continued to work on our websites. I struggled with the position command, and hopefully I'll get it done when Ms. Josephs comes back. I added a font into the titeles for the links to my projects/about me/journal. Science test is next and I hope I do well *fingers crossed*
</p>
<h1>

<p>
 Today we developed our websites further, learning how to make boxes, move them around, create borders, and create text within them. I further polished up my website, specifically my journal page, changing fonts and adding new entries.
</p>
<h1>
	10/13/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today I chose prompt two to develop my websites. I am still not sure about positioning, but I made a lab to go over it. I also added new journal entries and chilled for most of the class, especially since I was stressed about a Math test upcoming later today.
</p>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
Today I fixed some of my positioning and made a project which has Pippin (my dog) move up in down on a tree in a forest. I liked making this project, as it familiarized me with importing external images and taught me how to be able to move an image around.
</p>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
  Today we worked on our jumpscares. I made a blank page, that when you click on it, it spawns a creepy clown face which makes a scream and spins around, before disappearing again. It was fun, and I became more familiar with javascript/eventListerners.
</p>
<h1>
	10/27/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today I developed my project page and added a journal entry I forgot about. I learned how to make a background and how to position better. These are my three question answers: 1) What does clientx/y mean? 2) Why do you need variables in the script? 3) What do the bubbles mean?
</p>
<h1>
	11/1/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we worked on our jumpscares and presented them to my class; i added a different sound to mine to make it more jumpscare-y and more funny. It was a good class, but I am stressing about a math quiz today :\
</p>
<h1>
	11/8/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we worked on making functions in JavaScript which creates an image, duplicates it at random coordinates on the page, and deletes and plays a sound once clicked on. I found this very interesting, as I found other ways to do the same things in Java Script as opposed to CSS, like making divs and styling them (adding width, height, image, etc.).
</p>
<h1>
	11/10/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we learned what a function in JavaScript is. It's basically a recipe, the equivilent a coffee maker as opposed to individual functions and divs, the equivilent of brewing coffee individually. It was very interesting to explore functions, as it deepened my understanding of JavaScript and was simply fun.
 <h1>
	11/15/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we learned more about eventListeners and "if" statements. We continued to work on our websites, beginning a "gratitude" project" using eventListeners and if statements. It was a very fun class and I enjoyed beginning this step of the project
 <h1>
	11/17/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we basically just continued to work on our projects. I learned how to assign a variable (x) and make an eventListener that would record x+1 after every click, saving x as x+1, so that it plays images 1-6.
</p>
<h1>
	11/N/A/23
</h1>
<p>
 I finished my gratitude card. It was basically that when you clik on one coordinate on the screen, a random image, numbered 1-5, will play, containing images of my friends. It was a very fun project where I could do what I want how I wanted to.

 Today we learned about the stigma around ChatGPT andhow to use it. Most people use it as a writing tool, but it's best as a tutor. We asked it questions and analogies to asnwer questions about CSS/Javascript. It was very helpful in 1. understanding aspects of code between the two languages, and 2. clarifing and defining the importance and usefullness of ChatGPT as a tutor and someone to answer questions rather than a writer.
</p>

 Today we worked on our dribble projects, which makes a certain number of basketballs depending on the amount specified in the JavaScript funciton. It was pretty tedious to me, but I found it extremely helpful. However, I still made a lab to familliarize myself with JavaScript more for future assignments and projects.
</p>

<p>
 Today we worked on our caterpillar projects. I am making a ball selector for Kobe Bryant, where you chose the ball he is shooting. managed to complete the CSS parts of the project, like the divs and positioning, but I am struggling on the JavaScript and eventListener part of it. So far, I have found myself to struggle less with CSS as opposed to JavaScript, but JavaScript is more fun to learn about.
</p>
<h1>
	12/8/23
</h1>
<p>
 Today we worked on our caterpillar projects. I finally figured out how to do my eventListener - it made a div with the image of one of the balls. It was very interesting, yet also very frustrating project; however, I come out of it with a greater understanding of JavaScript's eventListeners, functions, and variables.
</p>
<h1>
	12/13/23
</h1>
<p>
Today we just finalized our caterpillar projects. I had pretty much finished, so i worked on quality-of-life things, like centering the image of Kobe and the basketballs and adding an instruction, saying "Click on one of the balls, and click on the existing ball in the image to select the one he shoots!". A VERY productive class.
</p>

<h1>
	1/10/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we starting working on array functions. I thought it was weird that CSS started counting at 0 instead of one, so you have to put one less than the amount of things in your eventListener for it to work propertly. However, I found it enjoyable to learn about arrays because it was a new concept which I had heard of or seen before.
</p>
<h1>

<p>
Today we watched a documentary briefly. I am writing this a few days after, and I kind of forget what it was about ðŸ˜…, but I do remember that it was somewhat interesting, definitely a nessecary switch-up from the usual lesson.
</p>
<h1>
	1/19/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we worked more on arrays. We looked at various projects which utilized arrays to perform functions like a slot machine, post card, or a gratitude card in form of a random image generator. I found it significantly easier to understand arrays once I looked at a project which worked with it.
</p>
<h1>
	1/24/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we worked some more on our arrays. I built a project which generates specific goals for 2024, including running more, reading more, and procrastinating less. It was a little confusing to create the array function, but after I got the hang of it, it was a smooth process.
</p>

Today we started working on our reveal.js slideshows. After a few minutes of brainstorming, I decided that I would create a slideshow of things that me and my brother can do this semester before he goes to college. I got alot of slides and work, but I still need to refine the project and finish 2 of the activity slides.
</p>
<h1>
	1/31/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we continued to work on our reveal.js slideshows. I worked a little bit on it during the class simply to finalize it, but I spent the majority of the class refining projects page, updating journal entries, and stressing for a math test.
</p>
<h1>

<p>
Today we began using "if" statement and our car.html projects. I made a lambo that uses various if statements to move it omnidirectionally and manuever through one of those old rugs detailing a town. It was very fun, and I think my next step is either 1. enabling the car's to move diagonally or 2. making the various town features explode upon impact with the car div.
</p>
<h1>

<p>
Today we started our mock-ups for our CSS valentine's day cards. I designed a love tester that allows someone to input two names and it generates a random number for the % of love.
</p>
<h1>
	2/9/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we had a sub and worked on our CSS valentines day card. I decided to alter my idea to a valentine/gratitude card to my family, making a project very similar to my gratitude card, but instead with my family and with different functions. It was overall a pretty fun class period.
</p>
<h1>
	2/14/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we worked on input functions, learning the ins and outs of it and how to generate a pop up at the top of the screen that tells the user something using an alert function.
</p>
<h1>
	2/16/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we made our websites up to date, making sure that we had an array project, a slideshow, a car project, and a valentines card in addition to supplementary journal entries. I worked on my valentines day card because it was the only thing not up to date (look to entry of 2/9 for more details).
</p>
<h1>
	2/21/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we learned about RGBA, the 3 different colors (red green blue) and opacity (alpha) that a computer pixel can generate. It was suprising that computers can create such a variety of colors with just three colors. I made a project that has a button, which when you press it, changes the page's background color. It mainly utilized the changeBackgrouncolor function and Math.random to perform the page's function.
</p>
<h1>
	2/23/24
</h1>
<p>
Four questions about color and computers
1. Why are RGB the only colors we actually see?
2. What factors determine a given animal's number of receptors?
3. How does one actually create a digital language (ex. JavaScript) in the first place, and get it to function properly?
</p>
<h1>
	3/6/24
</h1>
<p>
Today, we started brainstorming ideas for our final project. We saw various previous final projects, like Quentin's, Rohan's, and Jasper's. I have pretty  decided what I want to do, something related to old computer interface (pre-desktop era). However, I have not determined how to incorporate this concept into the creation of a project.
</p>
<h1>
	4/5/24
</h1>
<p>
Today we continued working on our final projects. What I decided is that I actually had been rushing my brainstorming process; i chose something involving retro computers, that sounded momentarily cool, but deep down was something that I could not feel motivated to work on for the majority of the rest of 9th grade. Instead, after recieving my scholastic awards, I decided that I was going to make a project where I would write a poem every other day, and at the end of the 30 days, document and explain how it went and what patterns I noticed.
</p>
<h1>
	4/17/24
</h1>
<p>
Next 5 steps in my project process;
1. Complete all requisitory poems (7 left as of today)
2. Finalize brainstorming for the style of my final project(website, slideshow, etc.)
3. Begin outlining and designing website design and arrangement
4. Design website
5. Finalize and edit website, consider any last changes (ex. more poems, more reflection, etc.)
</p>

<p>
Today I continued to work on my poems, the latest one I've produced being titled "A Dancing Spring". As of yet, while writing these five poems, I have not noticed any patterns in the style of writing progressing, but what has is my comfortability with how and speed at which I am able to produce the same quality of work. My poems have too, as of yet, been largely been related to the seasons, heavily inspired by Robert Frost.
</p>
<h1>
4/19/24-5/8/24
</h1>
<p>
Today I finished my 10 poems. I have noticed that I am drifting away from imagery/Robert Frost type poems, and shifting more towards personal experiences, like "Solitude", "Pulled", and "House". Concerning general patterns, I have noticed that I have become more comfortable with the 4 line 3 stanza format; producing a poem of identical quality consumes a significantly smaller amount of time, amounting to about a 50% increase in efficiency, than it used to in April.
