	How to add things to my online version of my website</h2>
</h1>
<p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Open the terminal and navigate to my foler by typing <b>cd ./desktop/benwied24.github.io</b></li>

 	<li> if I want to see if I added anything, I can type <b>git status</b> and it will show me the changes i haven't saved to my online version</li>

 	<li> To add what i made I type <b>git add .</b></li>

 	<li> Then I make my changes and this means adding a little note marking what I did so i say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

 	<li> To finish vinixh ig off and put my changes online I type <b>git push </b></li>

 </ol>

 Yesterday we learned about the terminal, how old computers used to work/operate, and set up our websites on github.com. It was very fun, and I got to be the person to present my screen to avoid confusion and errors i might come across.

 Today we just developed our websites. My position tag doesn't work but I managed to simplify my code so i got something done. I installed a gif for my about me page link and I also got more proficient with the terminal and how to upload progress to the internet.

	Today we continued to work on our websites. I struggled with the position command, and hopefully I'll get it done when Ms. Josephs comes back. I added a font into the titeles for the links to my projects/about me/journal. Science test is next and I hope I do well *fingers crossed*

 Today we developed our websites further, learning how to make boxes, move them around, create borders, and create text within them. I further polished up my website, specifically my journal page, changing fonts and adding new entries.

 Today I chose prompt two to develop my websites. I am still not sure about positioning, but I made a lab to go over it. I also added new journal entries and chilled for most of the class, especially since I was stressed about a Math test upcoming later today.

Today I fixed some of my positioning and made a project which has Pippin (my dog) move up in down on a tree in a forest. I liked making this project, as it familiarized me with importing external images and taught me how to be able to move an image around.

  Today we worked on our jumpscares. I made a blank page, that when you click on it, it spawns a creepy clown face which makes a scream and spins around, before disappearing again. It was fun, and I became more familiar with javascript/eventListerners.

 Today I developed my project page and added a journal entry I forgot about. I learned how to make a background and how to position better. These are my three question answers: 1) 2) 3)
