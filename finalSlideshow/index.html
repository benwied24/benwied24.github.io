					<h1>My Process</h1>
					<p1>I started out by brainstorming each poem, before drafting it and editing it. After I was finished with all 10, I started to add effects to certain words/phrases, bracket-ing certain words to indicate that it had an effect.</p1>

					<h1>My experiences</h1>
					<p1>
					I learned alot about certain words that can be useful in my style of poetry. Sometimes, the poetry I was writing served as a sort of outlet for any bad emotions/thoughts I felt.
