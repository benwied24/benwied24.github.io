	<h1>
Poem of 4/5/24
</h1>
<p>
In the midst of some test, in some class, in some place
I grasp and drift away on daydream's gesticulating wing,
Weaving me through the clouds and blue sky alike
To the realm of fantasy of which boredom brings about

Drifting into a world of wonder,
Where my reality and worldly concerns fade away,
Where fierce dragons roar, giants slumber, and welcoming taverns buzz and hum,
In whispered echoes of fantastical shades.

But, as soon as it began, a bell rings, bringing about a utopia’s conclusion,
Back to what’s real, where my daydreams must suspend.
From a world where fantasy lingers free, to a beckoning and harsh reality
To a reality in which I, head down, dejectedly hand in an incomplete test.
</p>
